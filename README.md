## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

To add custom styling to radio buttons by 
1. erasing default styling on `<input>`
2. then add styling to it's `<label>`

```css
input:checked + label {
  cursor: default;
  background-color: var(--medium-grey);
}
```
For this CSS to work `<label>` has to be placed after the `<input>` element.
```js
<input value={n} onClick={() => setSelectedRating(n)} id={n.toString()} name="rating" type="radio" required/>
<label htmlFor={n.toString()}>{n}</label>
```
